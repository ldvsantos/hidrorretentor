To the Editor,

Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Organic hydroretentive core as a substrate for soil bioengineering" for consideration in Industrial Crops and Products.

This study examines the engineering of the invasive macrophyte Typha domingensis into functional hydroretentive cores for seedling support. Moving beyond simple biomass compatibility, we propose a composite framework where the lignocellulosic matrix is structured with castor oil-based polyurethane to function simultaneously as a hydraulic buffer and a biostimulant delivery system.

We show that the coupling of fiber and resin (N1) optimizes the physicochemical interface, creating a neutral pH environment with high Potassium availability that acts as a "fertility island" for establishment; that the functionalized core exhibits significant hydraulic hysteresis, amplifying water retention capacity by 2.7 times compared to controls; and that survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier/Cox) confirms the absence of phytotoxicity, revealing instead a hormetic biostimulation pattern where the substrate enhances morphogenetic vigor without compromising germination kinetics.

Our manuscript contributes to the journal’s scope by offering an empirically grounded framework for valorizing Typha biomass, specifying the hydroretentive core not merely as a physical support, but as an active eco-material where functional service life and biological compatibility are treated as design parameters constrained by chemical architecture.

We confirm that this work is original and not under review elsewhere, and that all authors meet the journal’s authorship criteria. Funding and data availability statements are provided in the submission files. Thank you for considering our submission.

Sincerely,
