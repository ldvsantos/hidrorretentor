# Cover letter — Industrial Crops and Products

To the Editor,

Please consider our manuscript, **“Organic hydroretentive core as a substrate for soil bioengineering”**, for publication as an **Original Research Article** in *Industrial Crops and Products*.

In this work, we evaluate a biodegradable hydroretentive core formulated from **Typha domingensis** (leaf residues and fibers) combined with a castor oil-based polyurethane resin and natural thickeners. We provide an integrated assessment connecting (i) **materials characterization** (FTIR/TGA), (ii) **core chemistry** (pH and macronutrients), (iii) **macroscopic water sorption**, and (iv) **bioassays** for early plant establishment, including germination metrics, seedling morphometry, and a tray mesocosm. The complete formulation ($N_1$) consistently improved germination and early morphogenesis without evidence of acute phytotoxicity, supporting the use of *Typha*-based hydroretentive cores as local hydrophysical conditioners for revegetation under controlled water supplementation.

We believe this submission fits the scope of *Industrial Crops and Products* because it advances the sustainable use of biomass from an industrially relevant macrophyte (*Typha*) into a functional bio-based material, while explicitly addressing performance and biological safety for agronomic/geoenvironmental applications.
