# Graphical abstract — brief (optional, but encouraged)

Elsevier journals often encourage a graphical abstract. If you decide to submit one, keep it **simple, readable, and self-explanatory**.

## Recommended structure for this paper

**Panel A — Material / manufacturing**
- Typha domingensis biomass → leaf residues + fibers
- Formulations N1–N4
- Castor oil-based polyurethane resin / D-limonene / natural thickeners

**Panel B — Test pipeline**
- Chemistry (pH, K, P)
- FTIR / TGA (thermal stability)
- Sorption test
- Bioassays (germination, GSI/MGT, morphometry, tray mesocosm)

**Panel C — Key takeaways**
- N1 increases early establishment
- No acute phytotoxicity signal
- Hydroretentive core acts as local hydrophysical conditioner

## Export checklist
- Use vector format (preferred) or high-resolution raster
- Use large font size and minimal text
- Keep consistent with Figure style and journal requirements
